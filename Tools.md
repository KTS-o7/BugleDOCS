## Work Flow

An investment bank is a financial institution that helps its clients with various aspects of raising capital, such as issuing securities, providing advisory services, facilitating mergers and acquisitions, and managing risk. [An investment bank typically has four main divisions: corporate finance, equity capital markets, debt capital markets, and research](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111114/whats-role-investment-bank.asp)[1](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111114/whats-role-investment-bank.asp)

- Corporate finance: This division provides financial advice and solutions to corporations on matters such as capital structure, valuation, restructuring, and capital raising.
- Equity capital markets: This division helps clients raise equity capital by underwriting initial public offerings (IPOs), managing secondary offerings (IPOs), and trading securities in the primary market.
- Debt capital markets: This division helps clients raise debt capital by underwriting bonds, loans, mortgages, and other fixed-income securities in the primary market.
- Research: This division provides research reports and analysis on various sectors, industries, companies, markets, and trends to help clients make informed investment decisions.

An asset management firm is a financial institution that manages the assets of institutional or individual investors on behalf of them. [An asset management firm typically has two main divisions: portfolio management and client service](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111114/whats-role-investment-bank.asp)[2](https://www.limina.com/blog/ux-ui-for-asset-managers-investment-management-workflow)

- Portfolio management: This division is responsible for selecting and managing the investments of the clients’ portfolios according to their objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and preferences. Portfolio managers use various strategies such as active or passive investing , value investing , growth investing , etc. to generate returns for the clients.
- Client service: This division is responsible for providing support and communication to the clients throughout their relationship with the asset management firm. Client service staff include account managers , relationship managers , compliance officers , etc.

A possible flow chart that illustrates these two types of firms working together could look something like this:

```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end: End
op1=>operation: Client needs financing
op2=>operation: Investment bank underwrites IPO
op3=>operation: Investment bank advises client
op4=>operation: Asset management firm selects investments
op5=>operation: Asset management firm manages portfolio
op6=>operation: Client receives returns

st->op1->op2->op3->e
e->op4->op5->e
```


## Investment banks
Investment banks play a crucial role in the financial industry, providing a variety of services to their clients. Here’s a general workflow of an investment bank:

1. **Client Onboarding**: The process begins with onboarding the client. [This involves understanding the client’s needs and setting up their account](https://www.bing.com/aclick?ld=e8R2AzEUnBg94UIzpTJ11aWjVUCUwBAlyBXT9scCA__LtDMAgtk4jXr_oeMBmShlDtDAAuvksQrC8BWK27CD1zC4NJRlUhlUGvZ15CFiAD3oUBU3sL7S_H5Ocl1LGulGothUPWo_aFVWX6fzW9pNZzEY5lQz95bTMJnrd9kihtR6Tv66Pd&u=aHR0cHMlM2ElMmYlMmZ3d3cucmVmaW5pdGl2LmNvbSUyZmVuJTJmcHJvZHVjdHMlMmZlaWtvbi10cmFkaW5nLXNvZnR3YXJlJTJmaW52ZXN0bWVudC1iYW5raW5nJTNmdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQlM2RFaWtvbi1TRy1BUEFDLUItRU4tQk1NJTI2dXRtX21lZGl1bSUzZGNwYyUyNnV0bV9zb3VyY2UlM2RiaW5nJTI2dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduJTNkNzQ4OTI4X1dvcmtzcGFjZUVpa29uR2VuZXJpY1BhaWRTZWFyY2gyMDIzJTI2ZWxxQ2FtcGFpZ25JZCUzZDIwNjg3JTI2dXRtX3Rlcm0lM2QlMmJpbnZlc3RtZW50JTI1MjAlMmJiYW5raW5nJTI1MjAlMmJ3b3JrZmxvdyUyNnNfa3djaWQlM2RBTCExMTM5NiExMCE4MDUzOTMxODQ0NjE5NiE4MDUzOTU5MTY0MTE0MSUyNmdjbGlkJTNkMzI4MThiNGRlYTkwMTFkYzlmMWVlZTFhZWQyNmFlYWElMjZnY2xzcmMlM2QzcC5kcyUyNm1zY2xraWQlM2QzMjgxOGI0ZGVhOTAxMWRjOWYxZWVlMWFlZDI2YWVhYQ&rlid=32818b4dea9011dc9f1eee1aed26aeaa)[1](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf).
    
2. **Transaction Processing**: Once the client is onboarded, the bank processes transactions on their behalf. [This could involve buying or selling securities, managing assets, or other financial activities](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf)[1](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf).
    
3. **Advisory Services**: Investment banks provide advisory services to their clients. [They work with clients to underwrite securities, source and organize Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As), and create financial models to inform their client’s decisions](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf)[2](https://www.theforage.com/blog/careers/investment-banking).
    
4. [**Capital Raising**: Investment bankers raise capital in the public markets, run private equity and debt capital placements, and conduct merger and acquisition (M&A) deals](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/100215/career-advice-investment-banking-vscorporate-finance.asp)[3](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/100215/career-advice-investment-banking-vscorporate-finance.asp).
    
5. **Sales and Client Management**: The bank also manages the client relationship, providing targeted and relevant research and digital content. [They integrate with modular platforms anchored by leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software providers, which support integration across ecosystems and utilize low code/no code workflow platforms to build front-to-back workflows](https://www.bing.com/aclick?ld=e8R2AzEUnBg94UIzpTJ11aWjVUCUwBAlyBXT9scCA__LtDMAgtk4jXr_oeMBmShlDtDAAuvksQrC8BWK27CD1zC4NJRlUhlUGvZ15CFiAD3oUBU3sL7S_H5Ocl1LGulGothUPWo_aFVWX6fzW9pNZzEY5lQz95bTMJnrd9kihtR6Tv66Pd&u=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&rlid=32818b4dea9011dc9f1eee1aed26aeaa)[1](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf).
    
6. **Settlement and Reporting**: After transactions are processed, the bank handles settlement and provides reporting to the client. [This involves ensuring that the securities are delivered to the buyer and the capital is transferred to the seller](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf)[1](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf).
    
7. [**Continuous Improvement**: Investment banks continuously strive to improve their client-facing technology functions across capital markets to transform the experience of their enterprise clients](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf)[1](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-client-facing-technologies-for-investment-banks.pdf).
    

## Workflow rules

## 1. Identify the Process:

Start by identifying the process or task you want to manage. It could be anything from a simple task to a complex project.

## 2. Define the Start and End Points:

Every workflow should have a clear start and end point. This helps to keep the process focused and prevents it from becoming too complex.

## 3. Identify the Steps:

List all the steps involved in the process. Try to include every task, decision point, and potential outcome.

## 4. Determine the Sequence of Steps:

Once you have identified all the steps, determine the order in which they should occur. Some steps may need to occur sequentially, while others can occur simultaneously.

## 5. Draw the Diagram:

Use a flowchart tool or software to draw the diagram. Start with the start point, add all the steps in their correct sequence, and then add the end point. Use arrows to indicate the flow of the process.

## 6. Review and Refine:

Review the diagram with your team and refine it as necessary. Make sure it accurately represents the process and is easy to understand.

## 7. Implement and Monitor:

Once the diagram is finalized, implement it in your organization. Monitor the process and make adjustments to the workflow as necessary.

## 8. Regular Updates:

Regularly update the workflow diagram to reflect any changes in the process. This will help to keep it relevant and useful.
